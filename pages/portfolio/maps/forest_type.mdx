# Forest Type Map

For this map a machine learning approach to classify forested areas in the Hunsr√ºck-Hochwald National Park into **deciduous** and **coniferous** forest was applied. The workflow was implemented for both the 2021 and 2025 Sentinel-2 imagery and forms the basis for the forest loss/forest change map in the last step of the portfolio together with the annual forest masks. Here only the results for 2025 are shown.

## Workflow
<Steps>
### Training data preparation
   * Load Sentinel-2 predictor stack and deciduous/coniferous training polygons
   * Extract spectral values per polygon and merge with class labels
### Model training
   * Setup 3-fold-leave-one-fold-out cross-validation
   * Train two Random Forest models (`randomForest` vs `ranger`) with 500 trees
   * Evaluate both using the Kappa and overall accuracy
   * Select the best model based on accuracy metrics
   * Extract and visualize variable importance of selected model
### Prediction and mapping
   * Predict deciduous vs. coniferous classes across the park
   * Mask to only get prediction for forested areas using the previously created forest mask
### Accuracy assessment
   * Generate stratified random samples
   * Create confusion matrix and calculate area-adjusted accuracy metrics (Olofsson et al., 2013, 2014)
