# Forest Change Map

This maps visualize forest change between 2021 and 2025 in the Hunsr√ºck-Hochwald National Park. They compares the overall forest loss as well as the loss by forest type and the transition that happened. The data layer used for creating this map are the ones resulting from the forest mask and forest type classification workflows shown in the previous steps of this portfolio.

## Workflow
<Steps>
### Data input
   * Load forest masks for 2021 and 2025
   * Load forest type map for 2021 and 2025
### Change detection
   * Subtract 2025 mask from 2021 mask
   * Subtract 2025 forest type map from 2021 forest type map
   * Assign change classes to resulting change maps
</Steps>
