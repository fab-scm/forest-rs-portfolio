# Reflection / Conclusion

This portfolio shows how I moved from single processing steps to a full, question-driven workflow for the Hunsrück-Hochwald National Park. Starting with LiDAR data to build a canopy height model, comparing spectral indices from Sentinel-2, training classifiers to map forest cover and forest types, and then using two dates (summer 2021 vs. summer 2025) to map forest change. Putting these pieces together helped me see how different data sources and methods can answer one practical question: where did the forest—especially spruce—decline, and how can we communicate that clearly?

Working with LiDAR was my first big lesson. Turning point clouds into DEM, DSM, and finally a CHM was a highly computational effort, especially because our area of interest was quite large. In total approximately 60 Gigabytes of data hat to be processed. As given workflows in GIS systems can hardly handle these amounts of data and are not really reproducible, I decided to use implement a prallel processing pipeline with the Point Data Abstraction Library (PDAL, 2025). Not only did I learn how to approach such huge amounts of data with limited processing power, but also how LiDAR data is usually structured and what pitfalls can occur when processing these data: LiDAR-derived DEMs, DSMs, and CHMs depend strongly on point classification, point density, and interpolation choices, since errors in ground points or canopy returns directly affect height accuracy. Grid resolution, noise filtering, and coordinate system consistency are equally important, as mismatches or outliers can introduce significant distortions. In this project, the LiDAR data mainly served as a structural baseline of canopy height and continuity, limited by the acquisition date and not suited for detecting recent change.

The NDVI vs. NDRE comparison pushed me to think about what each index can actually deliver as an information layer in forests. To compare I sampled several pixels from different locations for four classes (deciduous forest, coniferous forest, dead standing and no forest) and plotted the index responses against each other. It clearly revealed how differently the indices respond to the canopy. NDVI and NDRE are both vegetation indices based on near-infrared reflectance but differ in the second band they use: NDVI relies on the red band, while NDRE uses the red-edge. NDVI is simple, widely established, and effective for detecting vegetation presence, canopy density, and general greenness, but it tends to saturate in dense forests and is sensitive to soil background. NDRE, on the other hand, is more sensitive to chlorophyll content and therefore better at detecting early stress or subtle changes in high-biomass canopies, though it requires sensors with red-edge bands and is less standardized. In practice, NDVI is best for broad vegetation mapping and long-term monitoring, while NDRE is more suited to forest health assessments and stress detection.

Defining forest as _living vegetation taller than 5 m_ build the baseline for subsequent analysis. It changed how training samples were picked, especially when sampling in dead-standing areas or scrub- and grassland. For the forest/non-forest and forest type maps, I used supervised classification (Random Forest) and then validated the results with stratified samples and area-adjusted accuracy metrics according to Oloffsson et al. (2013 and 2014). This was one of the most useful parts of the course for me: thinking statistically about maps. Instead of treating the map as “truth,” I now see it as an estimate with uncertainty that I need to report and explain.

The forest change map (2021–2025) is the piece that connects everything to the research question. It highlights where loss consolidated and how it lines up with spruce stands. It also shows the limits of a simple two-date approach (e.g. cloud/shadow cover and seasonal matching matter a lot). The 10 m Sentinel-2 resolution means I will not catch every single-tree mortality event or very narrow features. Still, as a clear and consistent product, the change map is useful for management: it points to where ground checks might be needed, where access or safety issues could arise, and where regeneration should be monitored.

Working on all these tasks across the semester with several open data sources (Sentinel-2, LiDAR, and public reference layers) showed me how important it is keeping everything organized in a reasoned data structure. On top it made clear to me that robust monitoring can be done in an open, reproducible way. On reproducibility: I specifically decided not to use GUI-based GIS Software for all of the data processing to enhance the reusability of my workflows. That means others can re-run the workflow, swap methods, or update them when new images arrive.

What do I take away from this? First, the value of a clear definition of a research question, a clean workflow and a good data structure - they reduce confusion later. Second, the importance of validation and uncertainty - it is not enough to show a nice map. Third, the need to communicate results in a way that is useful to non-experts: good legends, consistent color ramps, and short, direct summaries on the map, as well as data and other sources.

Overall, this course helped me to get a good overview of the practical work in the field of forest remote sensing, not only in the academic but also the administrative context. I now feel more confident building end-to-end remote sensing workflows and communicating maps that are open, interpretable, and honest about their limitations.
